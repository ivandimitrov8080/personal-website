It does so for the currently used sink.
For dwmblocks to update the value on the screen I&amp;rsquo;ve set up an update signal so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get updated every second unnecessarily. There&amp;rsquo;s a keybind for increasing and decreasing the volume that I&amp;rsquo;ve added to my sxhkd config.

Notice that I said JVM and not Java, because Kotlin is also used in app development.
