I know that Java and [suckless](https://suckless.org/) are like cat and mouse, but hear me out, OK?

Suckless refers to software that's as minimalistic as possible leaving every optional feature out of the final product.
That leaves you with a small codebase for each package that's easy to maintain and has less security holes, because of the smaller attack surface compared to bigger projects.

Those smaller packages usually do one thing very well, which means that any additional functionality needs to be provided by a different program.
Usually, there's more than one way to acheive a goal, so if you want something done you are free to pick and choose your tool, which is nice if you like DIY stuff.
All that is in line with the unix philosophy.

There are some difficulties when it comes to suckless software like:

 - [Documentation? The source code is the documentation, bro!](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm)

Suckless software is actually pretty good once you get the hang of it, but until then it's a pain.
I will attempt to describe the solutions to various problems I've had with suckless here.
