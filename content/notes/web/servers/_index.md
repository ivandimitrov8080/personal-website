You've probably heard of web servers, which are computers designed to "serve" web pages to "clients".
A client is a program consuming the server's services.
You (technically your browser), as the reader of this article, are a client, and GitHub is the server at the time of me writing this.

There are other types of servers out there apart from web servers.
For example the [the X11 server](https://askubuntu.com/questions/7881/what-is-the-x-server) is a graphics server used to manage displays and some input devices.

So, in a nutshell, a server is a program that provides services to clients.
