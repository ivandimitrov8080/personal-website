> [Unix (/ˈjuːnɪks/; trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969[1] at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)

My Unix operating system of choice is GNU/Linux, which is a free as in libre open-source Unix-based operating system comprised of the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org/) and the [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/).

GNU/Linux comes in many flavours, AKA distributions. The distro I'm currently using as of 08/2022 is a minimal [Artix linux](https://artixlinux.org/) running OpenRC. Neofetch says this:

It's a really customizable Linux distro, as it's just [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with a different [init system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init).
This makes it a perfect distro for tinkering and making it my own.

Here are some things I've configured for myself.
