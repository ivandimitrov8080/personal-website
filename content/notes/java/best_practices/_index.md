With enterprise development, there's something called "code maintainability".
That's the measure of how easy it is for a given codebase to be maintained
by multiple developers at any given time.

When  there's new features being added, the complexity of the entire codebase increases.
Given enough time,
everything can become so complex that the addition of a simple feature,
or a simple bug fix,
can take multiple times more time than it used to when the code was new.

Developers can strive to reduce this by following clean coding standards which,
if employed properly, can reduce the complexity increases with time.
