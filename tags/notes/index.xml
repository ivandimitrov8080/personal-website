It is used with dwm to display status bar information.
The status bar is at the top right corner. It shows information like current date, time, weather, network IO, RAM usage and volume. That information gets updated based on predefined rules in your configuration file, which might look something like this:
//Modify this file to change what commands output to your statusbar, and recompile using the make command.</description></item><item><title>Suckless</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 16:07:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/</guid><description>I know that Java and suckless are like cat and mouse, but hear me out, OK?
Suckless refers to software that&amp;rsquo;s as minimalistic as possible leaving every optional feature out of the final product. That leaves you with a small codebase for each package that&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and has less security holes, because of the smaller attack surface compared to bigger projects.
Those smaller packages usually do one thing very well, which means that any additional functionality needs to be provided by a different program.</description></item><item><title>Servers</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/servers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/servers/</guid><description>Being a general purpose programming language, Java can be useful in many ways, including server applications.
Java is mostly used as a web server programming language. Frameworks like Spring Framework are utilised to help build highly scalable and efficient web services. It is used by companies like Google, Netflix, Uber and more.
The code for a basic server is less than 30 lines long.

This is its architecture. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in the APPLICATION FRAMEWORK component, because that&amp;rsquo;s where all the JVM stuff happens. Notice that I said JVM and not Java, because Kotlin is also used in app development.
Android utilises the event-driven architecture to interact with the app user. Programmer-defined EventListeners listen for events and when the appropriate event is fired then all listeners listening for that event execute their business logic.</description></item><item><title>Applications</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:17:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</guid><description>These are some use cases I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for Java.</description></item><item><title>Java</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:02:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/</guid><description>Java is a general purpose programming language designed to run on any platform with the help of the JVM . It is one of the most popular programming languages as of 2022 accorging to Stack Overflow .
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Java for the majority of my professional career. Here are some things that I find interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
