That&amp;rsquo;s the measure of how easy it is for a given codebase to be maintained by multiple developers at any given time.
When there&amp;rsquo;s new features being added, the complexity of the entire codebase increases. Given enough time, everything can become so complex that the addition of a simple feature, or a simple bug fix, can take multiple times more time than it used to when the code was new.</description></item><item><title>One_thing</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/best_practices/one_thing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 15:19:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/best_practices/one_thing/</guid><description>Object Oriented Programming has a set principles called SOLID. Baeldung has an article on them .
What I want to talk about here is the Single Responsibility Principle. That&amp;rsquo;s the S in SOLID.
As we might expect, this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
I had a discussion about this on some code I was reviewing. These are some CR comments.</description></item></channel></rss>
