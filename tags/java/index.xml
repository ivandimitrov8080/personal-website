That&amp;rsquo;s the measure of how easy it is for a given codebase to be maintained by multiple developers at any given time.
When there&amp;rsquo;s new features being added, the complexity of the entire codebase increases. Given enough time, everything can become so complex that the addition of a simple feature, or a simple bug fix, can take multiple times more time than it used to when the code was new.</description></item><item><title>One_thing</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/best_practices/one_thing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 15:19:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/best_practices/one_thing/</guid><description>Object Oriented Programming has a set principles called SOLID. Baeldung has an article on them .
What I want to talk about here is the Single Responsibility Principle. That&amp;rsquo;s the S in SOLID.
As we might expect, this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
I had a discussion about this on some code I was reviewing. These are some CR comments.</description></item><item><title>Servers</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/servers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/servers/</guid><description>Being a general purpose programming language, Java can be useful in many ways, including server applications.
Java is mostly used as a web server programming language. Frameworks like Spring Framework are utilised to help build highly scalable and efficient web services. It is used by companies like Google, Netflix, Uber and more.
The code for a basic server is less than 30 lines long.

This is its architecture. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in the APPLICATION FRAMEWORK component, because that&amp;rsquo;s where all the JVM stuff happens. Notice that I said JVM and not Java, because Kotlin is also used in app development.
Android utilises the event-driven architecture to interact with the app user. Programmer-defined EventListeners listen for events and when the appropriate event is fired then all listeners listening for that event execute their business logic.</description></item><item><title>Applications</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:17:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</guid><description>These are some use cases I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for Java.</description></item><item><title>Java</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:02:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/</guid><description>Java is a general purpose programming language designed to run on any platform with the help of the JVM . It is one of the most popular programming languages as of 2022 accorging to Stack Overflow .
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Java for the majority of my professional career. Here are some things that I find interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
