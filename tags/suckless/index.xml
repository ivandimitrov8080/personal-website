Suckless refers to software that&amp;rsquo;s as minimalistic as possible leaving every optional feature out of the final product. That leaves you with a small codebase for each package that&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and has less security holes, because of the smaller attack surface compared to bigger projects.
Those smaller packages usually do one thing very well, which means that any additional functionality needs to be provided by a different program.</description></item></channel></rss>
