Java is mostly used as a web server programming language. Frameworks like Spring Framework are utilised to help build highly scalable and efficient web services. It is used by companies like Google, Netflix, Uber and more.
The code for a basic server is less than 30 lines long.

This is its architecture. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in the APPLICATION FRAMEWORK component, because that&amp;rsquo;s where all the JVM stuff happens. Notice that I said JVM and not Java, because Kotlin is also used in app development.
Android utilises the event-driven architecture to interact with the app user. Programmer-defined EventListeners listen for events and when the appropriate event is fired then all listeners listening for that event execute their business logic.</description></item><item><title>Applications</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:17:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/java/applications/</guid><description>These are some use cases for Java.
