It does so for the currently used sink.
For dwmblocks to update the value on the screen I&amp;rsquo;ve set up an update signal so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get updated every second unnecessarily. There&amp;rsquo;s a keybind for increasing and decreasing the volume that I&amp;rsquo;ve added to my sxhkd config.
super + i volume set -i 5 super + o volume set -d 5 The way it works step by step:</description></item><item><title>Dwmblocks</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/dwmblocks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 16:35:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/dwmblocks/</guid><description>dwmblocks is a modular status bar written in c . It is used with dwm to display status bar information.
The status bar is at the top right corner. It shows information like current date, time, weather, network IO, RAM usage and volume. That information gets updated based on predefined rules in your configuration file, which might look something like this:
//Modify this file to change what commands output to your statusbar, and recompile using the make command.</description></item><item><title>Suckless</title><link>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 16:07:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivandimitrov.co.uk/notes/suckless/</guid><description>I know that Java and suckless are like cat and mouse, but hear me out, OK?
Suckless refers to software that&amp;rsquo;s as minimalistic as possible leaving every optional feature out of the final product. That leaves you with a small codebase for each package that&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and has less security holes, because of the smaller attack surface compared to bigger projects.
Those smaller packages usually do one thing very well, which means that any additional functionality needs to be provided by a different program.</description></item></channel></rss>
