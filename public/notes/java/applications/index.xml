      <description>Android is an open source mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel created by Google. This is its architecture. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in the APPLICATION FRAMEWORK component, because that&amp;rsquo;s where all the JVM stuff happens. Notice that I said JVM and not Java, because Kotlin is also used in app development.
Android utilises the event-driven architecture to interact with the app user. Programmer-defined EventListeners listen for events and when the appropriate event is fired then all listeners listening for that event execute their business logic.</description>
